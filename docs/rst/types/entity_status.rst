EntityStatus
============

The *eProsima Fast DDS Statistics Backend* keeps track of the entities status.
The following list shows the possible status values along with their corresponding descriptions.

- |OK-api|: The entity is functioning optimally and there are no issues to report.
- |WARNING-api|: The entity is operating with some warnings or minor issues.
  Although it's still functional, some attention may be required.
- |ERROR-api|: The entity has encountered critical errors and its normal operation is disrupted.
  Immediate action is necessary to resolve the problem.
