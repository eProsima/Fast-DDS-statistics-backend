Listeners
=========

Listeners allow users to define actions that will be taken
in response to changes in the monitored elements, e.g.,
when the deployment layout changes or when new statistical data
has been received.

There are two kinds of listeners:

- :ref:`listeners_domain_listener` acts upon changes in the DDS entities
  of the deployment or new statistical data arrives.
- :ref:`listeners_physical_listener` acts upon changes in the physical entities
  of the deployment.
