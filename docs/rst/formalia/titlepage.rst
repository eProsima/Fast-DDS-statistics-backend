Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

*eProsima Fast DDS Statistics Backend* is a C++ library to collect data from the *Fast DDS Statistics module* and
generate statistical information to be used by applications.

This database-like tool enhances the monitoring of the health of *Fast DDS* entities. Additionally, it offers a
useful depiction of the *Fast DDS* system in a graph-like format. This visualization aids in understanding the
system's structure and behavior in an accessible manner.

.. warning::

  To monitor a DDS network deployed using the *Fast DDS* library, it must be compiled with statistics and
  the statistics module must be explicitly enabled. See `Statistics Module DDS Layer
  <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/statistics/dds_layer/statistics_dds_layer.html>`_
  for more details.

.. warning::
  If *Fast DDS* has been compiled with statistics and they are explicitly enabled and statistical data are not correctly
  received, only few data arrive or even none, configure the Fast DDS endpoints publishing statistics data with a less
  restrictive memory constraints.
  Please check the following
  `documentation <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/statistics/dds_layer/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting>`_
  for more details on how to do this.
