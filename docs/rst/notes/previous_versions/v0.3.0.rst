Version 0.3.0
=============

This release has the following **API breaks**:

* `StatisticsBackend::dump_database` methods now have an additional argument `clear`.

This release adds the following **features**:

* Dumping the database can optionally delete the traffic data from the internal data structures
  after the dump is completed, in order to reduce memory footprint.
* Support to create monitors on discovery server networks.
* Statistics data related to meta-traffic are now collected under the builtin meta-traffic endpoint
  created on each participant.
* Entities removed from the network now have a *non-active* status.
* Transitions between active and non-active status are notified to the user listeners.
* It is possible to change the domain listener and mask after the monitor is created.

This release includes the following **bug fixes and improvements**:

* By default, statistics data is received using UDP transport, shared memory is disabled.
* Network latency data now relates to a source participant and a destination locator
  (previously a source locator and a destination locator).
* Statistics data can now trigger the discovery of a new locator.
* Improved entity names and aliases to be more user friendly.
* Solved an issue that may cause the internal database to freeze.
* Allow for topics with the same name to be on different domains.
