Version 0.2.0
-------------

This minor release is API compatible with the previous minor release, but introduces **ABI breaks**:

* Methods and attributes have been added on several classes, so indexes of
  symbols on dynamic libraries may have changed.

This release adds the following **features**:

* Support for Windows platforms
* Dumped data can now be loaded to the backend
* Backend can now be reset to a clean state (deleting all the data and monitors)
* StatisticsBackend::get_data implementation for SAMPLE_DATAS and DISCOVERY_TIME sample types
* StatisticsBackend::get_data implementation for zero bins

It also includes the following **improvements**:

* The participant info now contains all the locators of the participant
* Entities have an alias that can be set by the user to facilitate identification

Some important **bugfixes** are also included:

* Fixed errors when the same topic name is used on different domains
* Fixed crashes on database queues when database operation fails
