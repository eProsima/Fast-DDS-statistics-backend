Clearing data
-------------

*eProsima Fast DDS Statistics Backend* monitors both the entities discovered in a certain DDS domain or *Fast DDS*
Discovery Server network, and the statistic data related to these entities.
|StatisticsBackend-api| provides several methods to clear the data contained in the internal database:

* |clear_statistics_data-api| commands the deletion of old statistics data contained within the database.
  The timestamp refers to the time from where to keep data.
  Use :code:`the_end_of_time()` to remove all data efficiently (used by default).
* |clear_inactive_entities-api| deletes from the database those :ref:`entities <types_entity_kind>` that are no longer
  alive and communicating (see :ref:`statistics_backend_is_active` for more information).
* |clear_monitor-api| clears all data (entities and statistics) related to a specific monitor.
  To do so, the corresponding monitor needs to be stopped before the |clear_monitor-api| operation can be performed.

.. warning::
    |clear_monitor-api| is currently not supported.
    It will be implemented on a future release of *Fast DDS Statistics Backend*.
