# ROS2Prometheus Example

In this example we set up a monitor which measures and prints the latency and throughput of the communication between a
ROS 2 talker and listener from the `demo_nodes_cpp` package.
This example also exports the statistics collected by the monitor to Prometheus.

## Additional dependencies

Additional dependencies are required to run this example.

* [C++ Prometheus exporter](https://github.com/eProsima/prometheus-cpp) (**required**)
Install this concrete version of *Prometheus exporter* by following any of the methods described in the given link.
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) (**optional**)
Follow the installation guide from the official website. The configuration file needed to run this example is provided under this same directory (`prometheus.yml`).

## Execution instructions

To launch this test open three different consoles:

* Console 1:

    ```bash
    export FASTDDS_STATISTICS="HISTORY_LATENCY_TOPIC;PUBLICATION_THROUGHPUT_TOPIC;PHYSICAL_DATA_TOPIC"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
    ```

* Console 2:

    ```bash
    export FASTDDS_STATISTICS="HISTORY_LATENCY_TOPIC;PUBLICATION_THROUGHPUT_TOPIC;PHYSICAL_DATA_TOPIC"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
    ```

* Console 3:

    ```bash
    ./ROS2Prometheus
    ```


## Arguments

```sh
Usage: ROS2Prometheus

General options:
  -h            --help              Produce help message.

Monitor options:
  -d <id>       --domain=<id>       DDS domain ID (Default: 0).

                                    (Default: 1) (0 => no mean calculation, return raw
                                    data).
  -t <num>      --time=<num>        Duration in seconds of each time frame
                                    (Default: 5).
