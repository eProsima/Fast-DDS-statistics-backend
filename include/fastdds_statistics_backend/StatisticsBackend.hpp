     * @brief Return the EntityKind of the entities to which a DataKind refers.
     *
     * Some DataKind relate to a single Entity of a given EntityKind.
     * This is the case of @c SUBSCRIPTION_THROUGHPUT, that always relates to a @c DATAREADER.
     * Other DataKind relate to two different Entity, each one of a given EntityKind.
     * For example, @c FASTDDS_LATENCY relates to a @c DATAWRITER as source
     * and a @c DATAREADER as target of the data flow.
     * In the specific case of @c DISCOVERY_TIME, the DataKind relates to a @c PARTICIPANT as the discoverer,
     * but can relate to a @c DATAWRITER, @c DATAREADER or another @c PARTICIPANT as the discovered entity.
     *
     * Given a DataKind, this method provides a collection of all pairs of EntityKind to which
     * this DataKind relates.
     *
     * - For a @c DataKind that only relates to one Entity, the first element of the pair is the EntityKind
     * of such Entity, while the second element is @ref EntityKind::INVALID.
     * - For a DataKind that relates to two Entity, the first element of the pair is the EntityKind
     * of the source Entity, while the second element is the EntityKind of the target Entity.
     *
     * The source and target pairs returned by this method are exactly the accepted source and target EntityKind
     * accepted by @ref get_data for the given DataKind.
     * This is convenient to prepare a call to @ref get_data from an EntityKind.
     * First, call @ref get_data_supported_entity_kinds with the EntityKind to get the EntityKinds
     * of the related entities.
     * Then, call @ref get_entities to get the available entities for that kind.
     * Finally, call @ref get_data with the pairs that @ref get_entities returns.
     *
     * i.e. Get the DISCOVERY_TIME of all entities on Host2 discovered by Host1:
     * @code
     * // Get all the EntityKind pairs related to DISCOVERY_TIME.
     * std::vector<std::pair<EntityKind, EntityKind>> types_list =
     *         StatisticsBackend::get_data_supported_entity_kinds(DataKind::DISCOVERY_TIME);
     *
     * // Iterate over all the valid pairs composing the final result
     * std::vector<StatisticsData> discovery_times;
     * for (std::pair<EntityKind, EntityKind> type_pair : types_list)
     * {
     *     // Take the data for this pair and append it to the existing data
     *     std::vector<StatisticsData> tmp = StatisticsBackend::get_data(
     *             DataKind::DISCOVERY_TIME,
     *             StatisticsBackend::get_entities(type_pair.first, host1_id),
     *             StatisticsBackend::get_entities(type_pair.second, host2_id));
     *
     *     discovery_times.insert(discovery_times.end(), tmp.begin(), tmp.end());
